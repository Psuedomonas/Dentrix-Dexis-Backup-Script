# Backup-Powershell
Automate Dentrix backup with powershell

Version 2

This is a console interface script that provides step by step instructions to backup Dexis, and automate a backup of Dentrix. The backup method for Dentrix is probably wasteful in the amount of files it copies, but it should ensure recovery.

The previous version utilized a crude windows forms interface, but I found it to be unnecessarily time consuming trying to sort out the GUI. The use case for this script, especially with the guide, is exceptionally narrow, so I assume this script would be best used as a guide to develop other backup scripts rather than to be used exactly as is and as intended.
