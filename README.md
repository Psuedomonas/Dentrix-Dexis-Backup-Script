Automate Backup Full

AutomateBackupFull.ps1 - script
AutomateBackupFull.bat - batch launcher

These scripts use so called 'dumb' backups, as these are simple and safest for our situation. ('Dumb' refers to a whole backup, verses a 'Smart' backup of changes)
This particular script copies the full directories of both Dexis and Dentrix as this seems to correlate to best recovery.
Version 2.4 will remain the version for using Dentrix and Dexis backup features.
